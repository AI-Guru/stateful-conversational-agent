# Conversational Agents

Conversational Agents are also known as that bots. Here you will find a simple
chatbot based on Keras that can answer simple user-requests.

The bot is based on the Bag-of-words method, which is a technology from Natural
Language Processing that maps words, sentences and whole texts to vectors.
